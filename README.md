# Aconcagua_Monitoring_Data

This repository contains chemical monitoring data obtained during a 2018 campaign in the River Aconcagua basin. The campaign was conducted by the FRAM - Centre for Future Chemical Risk Assessment and Management Strategies at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the occurrence and levels of emerging chemicals, such as pesticides, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), surfactants, and industrial chemicals, at nine specific sampling locations. We cordially encourage researchers to make use of the cited references for proper attribution.
